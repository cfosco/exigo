            <hr class="light my-4">
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Exigo is a Greek word meaning "to measure or weigh against a standard."  We named
            our report after this idea of weighing against a standard because our dashboard will act as that
          standard used to weigh a model.  Our dashboard will give credit analysts insights into the accuracy,
          fairness and reasons behind the model's decisions.  We hope the dashboard will increase both a
          credit analyst's speed to make a decision and accuracy in making the right decisions.

          Exigo leverages the blockchain to connect a user-friendly, scalable platform to multiple
            decentralized IoT devices around the globe. Using the latest Machine Learning techniques, Exigo delivers state-of-the-art artificial intelligence
          knowledge straight to your screen. Our big-data approach is fully cloud-based and is commited to providing the best user experience in the market.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading text-white">What is the goal of the project?</h2>
          <pclass="text-faded mb-4">The high-level goal of our project was to create a tool that will be practically
          useful for credit analysts making decisions about which applicants to give loans to
          and which applicants to deny.  We approach this problem with a dashboard that displays
          pertinant information for a credit analyst to make a decision with the aid of a
          machine learning model.  Credit analysts will not only be aided by the model, but they
          will be able to see <em>why</em> the model made the decision it made.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading text-white">Why does anyone care?</h2>

          <pclass="text-faded mb-4">This project is especially important in our current day and age. We are in a era where
          machine learning algorithms are rapidly growing in popularirty
          and prevalence.  These algorithms are making more and more decisions that effect people
          on a daily basis.  Since the algorithms are only as good as the data we feed into them, they
          are succeptible to taking in and actually <em>replicating</em> a bias toward or against a
          protected class.  This is a deeply rooted issue becasue the bias might not just be in a
          "sensitive" feature like race or religion that is in the dataset, but can be carried through
          other, allegedly safe, features that can act as proxies for the protected class. There is a ethical
          motivation to test our decision-making algorithms to ensure they are not biased against certain
          protected classes. In addition to treating all people <em>fairly</em>, in the context of lending, we
          need to be able to give reasons why a potential customer was denied a loan. Giving reasons for why
          a customer was denied a loan is not only useful for the customer, but required by
          General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

            <p>Before we can really attack a problem, we have to know the data we are using inside and out.
            We are using a publically available dataset from LendingClub that dates from 2007-2017 and
            has around 1.6 million loans and 114 different features.  Although the dataset has 1.6
            million total loans, Just under 50% of them are current loans that have not either
            been defaulted on or paid back.  We will ignore these loans for modeling purposes,
            which leaves us with a dataset of around 850k loans. </p>

            Our main objective during this project was to generate a responsive report that could give insights on fairness and itnerpretability measures
            in a model-agnostic way. To accomplish this, we generated different models, implemented fairness methods and interpretability techniques. We describe the work below.

            <h3 class="section-heading">Models</h3>
            <p>
            Our project revolves around determining accurate metrics for fairness and interpretability, so we naturally needed a
            varied set of models to test our algorithms on. With that in mind, we decided to train 7 different models on the LendingClub
            dataset, with varying parameters and values, so that we could later on test our interpretability metrics on them. It is important to remark
            that accuracy was not our prime objective, but we were instead looking for varied models to refine our final deliverable: the dynamic report.
            The main models analyzed are detailed below.

            The training problem was set up as follows: we tried to predict if a particular client was going to default or repay their loan,
            given 114 features that describe their situation and characteristics (datapoints obtained from the publicly available LendingClub data).
            The data has a lot of categorical features and unusable predictors, so a round of data cleaning was needed.
            We removed useless predictors such as client id and loan id, transformed dates into categoricals and categoricals into one-hot encoded variables,
            removed columns with zero variance, and finally applied mean imputation to the cleaned dataset to fill out all the NaN values.

            We ended up with a dataset containing 194 features. This was fed to our models and we observed an unreasonably high accuracy on most of them.
            After this, we realized that some features clearly contained information posterior to the loan outcome. We removed most during the initial cleaning,
            but some remained. Features such as <span style="color:blue">debt_settlement_flag</span>, a flag that indicates if a charged-off borrower is working with a debt settlement company,
            were easy to detect as post-facto, but other features such as <span style="color:blue">funded_amnt</span>, the total amount committed by the loan at that point in time,
            were harder to catch.

            After removing the post-facto features, we ended up with a new model with 150 features that had much more realistic results. We operated
            hyperparameter search with a grid search approach on all of our models. We tried the following hyperparameters:

            <li><span style="color:green;">1.</span>Logistic Regression</li>
            <li><span style="color:green;">2.</span>Decision Tree</li>
            <li><span style="color:green;">3.</span>Random Forest</li>
            <li><span style="color:green;">4.</span>AdaBoost</li>
            <li><span style="color:green;">5.</span>XGBoost</li>
            <li><span style="color:green;">6.</span>LightGBM</li>
            <li><span style="color:green;">7.</span>Multi-Layer Perceptron</li>

            and we obtained respectable results, as we show below.

            <p>
              As this is a highly imbalanced problem, we also obtained ROC curves and confusion matrices for our models, to further present the
              performance of our model. These figures are part of the final report that we generate later on. We present some of them below.

                            This paper was one of our favorites and gave us the four main metrics we use to
                            evaluate the fairness of a model.  This paper goes in depth with different statistical
                            definitions of fairness and the justification for each metric.  The four metrics we use from
                            this paper are statistical parity, conditional statistical parity, false positive rate, and
                            false negative rate.

                        Our project revolves around determining accurate metrics for fairness and interpretability, so we naturally needed a
                        varied set of models to test our algorithms on. With that in mind, we decided to train 7 different models on the LendingClub
                        dataset, with varying parameters and values, so that we could later on test our interpretability metrics on them.
                        The main models analyzed were:

                        <p>
                        The training problem was set up as follows: we tried to predict if a particular client was going to default or repay their loan,
                        given 114 features that describe their situation and characteristics (datapoints obtained from the publicly available LendingClub data).
                        The data has a lot of categorical features and unusable predictors, so a round of data cleaning was needed.
                        We removed useless predictors such as client id and loan id, transformed dates into categoricals and categoricals into one-hot encoded variables,
                        removed columns with zero variance, and finally applied mean imputation to the cleaned dataset to fill out all the NaN values.

                        After this, we realized that some features clearly contained information posterior to the

                        We ended up with a dataset containing 194 features. After one-hot encoding, the grade and subgrade features transformed into 36 columns, for example.
