                        <p class="text-faded mb-4">Exigo is a Greek word meaning "to measure or weigh against a standard."  We named
                        our report after this idea of weighing against a standard because our dashboard will act as that
                        standard used to weigh a model.  Our dashboard will give credit analysts insights into the accuracy,
                        fairness and reasons behind the model's decisions.  We hope the dashboard will increase both a
                        credit analyst's speed to make a decision and accuracy in making the right decisions.

                        Exigo leverages the blockchain to connect a user-friendly, scalable platform to multiple
                        decentralized IoT devices around the globe. Using the latest Machine Learning techniques, Exigo delivers state-of-the-art artificial intelligence
                        knowledge straight to your screen. Our big-data approach is fully cloud-based and is commited to providing the best user experience in the market.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading text-white">What is the goal of the project?</h2>
                        <pclass="text-faded mb-4">The high-level goal of our project was to create a tool that will be practically
                        useful for credit analysts making decisions about which applicants to give loans to
                        and which applicants to deny.  We approach this problem with a dashboard that displays
                        pertinant information for a credit analyst to make a decision with the aid of a
                        machine learning model.  Credit analysts will not only be aided by the model, but they
                        will be able to see <em>why</em> the model made the decision it made.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading text-white">Why does anyone care?</h2>

                        <pclass="text-faded mb-4">This project is especially important in our current day and age. We are in a era where
                        machine learning algorithms are rapidly growing in popularirty
                        and prevalence.  These algorithms are making more and more decisions that effect people
                        on a daily basis.  Since the algorithms are only as good as the data we feed into them, they
                        are succeptible to taking in and actually <em>replicating</em> a bias toward or against a
                        protected class.  This is a deeply rooted issue becasue the bias might not just be in a
                        "sensitive" feature like race or religion that is in the dataset, but can be carried through
                        other, allegedly safe, features that can act as proxies for the protected class. There is a ethical
                        motivation to test our decision-making algorithms to ensure they are not biased against certain
                        protected classes. In addition to treating all people <em>fairly</em>, in the context of lending, we
                        need to be able to give reasons why a potential customer was denied a loan. Giving reasons for why
                        a customer was denied a loan is not only useful for the customer, but required by
                        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

                        <p>Before we can really attack a problem, we have to know the data we are using inside and out.
                        We are using a publically available dataset from LendingClub that dates from 2007-2017 and
                        has around 1.6 million loans and 114 different features.  Although the dataset has 1.6
                        million total loans, Just under 50% of them are current loans that have not either
                        been defaulted on or paid back.  We will ignore these loans for modeling purposes,
                        which leaves us with a dataset of around 850k loans. </p>

                        <p>Here we review the papers that were most useful to us in deciding which direction
                        to follow throughout the project.</p>

                        <h6>Local Interprable Model-agnostic Explainations: LIME</h6>
                        <li>LIME is one of the most important elements of our final dashboard.  We use this method to
                            explain the local results of the model in question and how much they influence the final decision
                            of the model. LIME fits a local linear approximation with a subset of the available features
                            to the function at a single point and uses the value of the coefficient on the features to determine which
                            ones are the most important. </li>

                        <p></p>

                        <h6>Input Gradients</h6>
                        <li>Input Gradient is another critically important method we use in our dashboard's
                            interpretability sections.  Input Gradients work by taking the gradient with respect to the x values
                            (inputs) of the model to see how the result of the model changes for small changes in the input.
                            Presumably, the features with a large gradient (i.e. that cause large change in the result of
                            the model for a small change to the feature's value), are the features that effect the output of the
                            model the most. </li>

                        <h6>Algorithmic Decision Making and the Cost of Fairness</h6>
                        <li>This paper was one of our favorites and gave us the four main metrics we use to
                            evaluate the fairness of a model.  This paper goes in depth with different statistical
                            definitions of fairness and the justification for each metric.  The four metrics we use from
                            this paper are statistical parity, conditional statistical parity, false positive rate, and
                            false negative rate.</li>

                        <h6>Fair Lending Laws and Regulations</h6>
                        <li>This was a dense, but useful document by the FDIC on current fair lending laws
                            and their application.  This document helped us define what current fairness laws are and

                        <p>
                        Our project revolves around determining accurate metrics for fairness and interpretability, so we naturally needed a
                        varied set of models to test our algorithms on. With that in mind, we decided to train 7 different models on the LendingClub
                        dataset, with varying parameters and values, so that we could later on test our interpretability metrics on them.
                        The main models analyzed were:
                        </p>

                        <li><span style="color:green;">1.</span>Logistic Regression</li>

                        <p>
                        The training problem was set up as follows: we tried to predict if a particular client was going to default or repay their loan,
                        given 114 features that describe their situation and characteristics (datapoints obtained from the publicly available LendingClub data).
                        The data has a lot of categorical features and unusable predictors, so a round of data cleaning was needed.
                        We removed useless predictors such as client id and loan id, transformed dates into categoricals and categoricals into one-hot encoded variables,
                        removed columns with zero variance, and finally applied mean imputation to the cleaned dataset to fill out all the NaN values.

                        After this, we realized that some features clearly contained information posterior to the

                        We ended up with a dataset containing 194 features. After one-hot encoding, the grade and subgrade features transformed into 36 columns, for example.

                                        <p class="text-faded mb-4">Exigo is a Greek word meaning "to measure or weigh against a standard."  We named
                                        our report after this idea of weighing against a standard because our dashboard will act as that
                                        standard used to weigh a model.  Our dashboard will give credit analysts insights into the accuracy,
                                        fairness and reasons behind the model's decisions.  We hope the dashboard will increase both a
                                        credit analyst's speed to make a decision and accuracy in making the right decisions.

                                        Exigo leverages the blockchain to connect a user-friendly, scalable platform to multiple
                                        decentralized IoT devices around the globe. Using the latest Machine Learning techniques, Exigo delivers state-of-the-art artificial intelligence
                                        knowledge straight to your screen. Our big-data approach is fully cloud-based and is commited to providing the best user experience in the market.</p>

                                        <h2 class="section-heading text-white">What is the goal of the project?</h2>
                                        <pclass="text-faded mb-4">The high-level goal of our project was to create a tool that will be practically
                                        useful for credit analysts making decisions about which applicants to give loans to
                                        and which applicants to deny.  We approach this problem with a dashboard that displays
                                        pertinant information for a credit analyst to make a decision with the aid of a
                                        machine learning model.  Credit analysts will not only be aided by the model, but they
                                        will be able to see <em>why</em> the model made the decision it made.</p>

                                        <h2 class="section-heading text-white">Why does anyone care?</h2>

                                        <pclass="text-faded mb-4">This project is especially important in our current day and age. We are in a era where
                                        machine learning algorithms are rapidly growing in popularirty
                                        and prevalence.  These algorithms are making more and more decisions that effect people
                                        on a daily basis.  Since the algorithms are only as good as the data we feed into them, they
                                        are succeptible to taking in and actually <em>replicating</em> a bias toward or against a
                                        protected class.  This is a deeply rooted issue becasue the bias might not just be in a
                                        "sensitive" feature like race or religion that is in the dataset, but can be carried through
                                        other, allegedly safe, features that can act as proxies for the protected class. There is a ethical
                                        motivation to test our decision-making algorithms to ensure they are not biased against certain
                                        protected classes. In addition to treating all people <em>fairly</em>, in the context of lending, we
                                        need to be able to give reasons why a potential customer was denied a loan. Giving reasons for why
                                        a customer was denied a loan is not only useful for the customer, but required by
                                        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

                                        <p>Before we can really attack a problem, we have to know the data we are using inside and out.
                                        We are using a publically available dataset from LendingClub that dates from 2007-2017 and
                                        has around 1.6 million loans and 114 different features.  Although the dataset has 1.6
                                        million total loans, Just under 50% of them are current loans that have not either
                                        been defaulted on or paid back.  We will ignore these loans for modeling purposes,
                                        which leaves us with a dataset of around 850k loans. </p>

                                                interpretability sections.  Input Gradients work by taking the gradient with respect to the x values
                                                (inputs) of the model to see how the result of the model changes for small changes in the input.
                                                Presumably, the features with a large gradient (i.e. that cause large change in the result of
                                                the model for a small change to the feature's value), are the features that effect the output of the
